## JavaScript Object Basics

- How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

  - Maybe like a "car" object with properties like "make," "model," and "year," and "condition"

- What are some advantages to creating object literals?
How do objects differ from arrays?

  - allow you to define key-value pairs to represent an object's properties
  - grouping related properties and functions together.
  - easily passed as arguments to functions or returned as values from functions
- The array has an ordered list of data, but an object is an unordered collection of key-value items that link to the object loosely.
  - In an array, the keys are always integers (i.e., indices), whereas in an object, the keys can be any string or symbol.
  - Arrays have a length property that tells you how many values are in the array, while objects do not have a length property.
  - Arrays have built-in methods like push, pop, and sort that allow you to add, remove, and rearrange elements in the array, whereas objects do not have these methods
  - Arrays are typically used to store and manipulate collections of similar values (e.g., a list of numbers), while objects are typically used to represent more complex data structures with different types of properties (e.g., a user object with properties like name, age, and email).

- Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.
Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?

      const dog = {
       name: 'Spot',
       age: 2,
       color: 'white with black spots',
      humanAge: function (){
         console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age*7} in human years`);
       }
     }

  - THIS method allows you to extract that you would like, in this case the name and age, which allows a multiplication of 7 to age. Making the code more concise and easier to understand.

### Introduction To The DOM

- What is the DOM?

  - The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML. Allowing you as the designer to  dynamically access and manipulate the content of the page.

  - The DOM is a tree structure that organizes elements on a web page, with each element represented by a node in the tree. The nodes can manipulate or modify content on the page when you change other ones. 

- Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.

  - JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM) work hand in hand to create a reactive website.

  - JavaScript can interact with the DOM by using its APIs to access and modify the properties and behavior of elements on the page.

  - Using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM, developers can create highly dynamic and responsive web pages that provide a more engaging and personalized user experience.
