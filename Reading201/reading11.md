## Video and Audio Content

- Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.

In the early 2000s, web browsers were not equipped to handle video and audio playback, so websites relied on plugins like Adobe Flash to enable multimedia content. It had a lot of issues and bugs. The first major breakthrough in video and audio on the web came with the introduction of HTML5 in 2014, which included native support for video and audio playback. With HTML5, web developers could also add various multimedia features like closed captions, subtitles, and interactive elements to enhance the user experience.

- Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the `<video>` element.

The `<video>` element is an HTML5 element that is used to embed video content into a web page.

The src attribute specifies the source of the video file that should be played. For example:

    <video src="https://example.com/myvideo.mp4"></video>

The controls attribute, on the other hand, adds a set of controls to the video player. Putting the controls attribute in the `<video>` element will enable the default set of controls.

Example of how to use the controls attribute in a `<video>` element:

    <video src="https://example.com/myvideo.mp4" controls></video>

- Why is it important to have fallback content inside the `<video>` element?

It's important to have fallback content inside the `<video>` element to ensure that users can still access the content in case the video cannot be played or displayed. Also for literal accessibility issues where the user couldn't access the content otherwise. While also considering SEO and web crawlers, to ensure website visibility online.

- Write a very short story where `<audio>` and `<video>` are characters.

Once upon a time, in a land called the World Wide Web, there lived two siblings named Audio and Video.

One day, they decided to collaborate on a new project. Audio composed a beautiful song, and Video choreographed an amazing animation to pair with it.

They became known as the ultimate power couple. Eventually dominating the bandwith of the WWW and stunning the media.

Because of their success together the lived happily ever after.

### A Complete Guide To Grid

- How does Grid layout differ from Flex?
Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.

Grid layout and Flexbox layout are two different CSS layout systems that are used to create complex and responsive web designs.

Flexbox is designed for creating one-dimensional layouts where items are arranged in a row or a column, while Grid is designed for creating two-dimensional layouts where items are arranged in rows and columns.

In other words, Flexbox is best suited for simpler layouts where items need to be aligned along a single axis, while Grid is best suited for more complex layouts that require alignment along both the row and column axes.

Grid container refers to the parent element that contains a grid layout. This element is usually set to display as `grid` in the CSS code and defines the grid as a series of rows and columns. The container can also specify the size of each row and column, the alignment of the grid, and any gaps between rows and columns.

Grid item refers to the child element of a grid container that is placed within the grid. The items are positioned within the grid using grid lines, which are imaginary lines that divide the grid into rows and columns. Each item can be placed on any combination of rows and columns, and can span multiple rows and columns if needed.

Grid lines are the lines that divide the grid into rows and columns. There are two types of grid lines: row lines and column lines. Each line has a number assigned to it, starting from 1, which can be used to position grid items within the grid. Grid lines can be visible or invisible, depending on the specific implementation.

### Responsive Images

Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?

1. Improved page load times: Images that are not optimized for different screen sizes can be very large in file size, which can slow down the loading of the page.
2. Improved user experience: Users on different devices have different screen sizes and resolutions.
3. Reduced data usage: Users on mobile devices may have limited data plans, and large images can quickly use up their data allowance.
4. Improved accessibility: Some users may have limited vision and rely on assistive technologies like screen readers to navigate web pages.

Define the following `<img>` attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.

Using the `srcset` and `sizes` attributes together is an important best practice for web developers to enable responsive images on different devices and ensure that the best image source is used for each device and viewport size.

1. srcset: The srcset attribute is used to specify a set of image sources for the `<img>` tag. Here's an example of how to use the srcset attribute in an `<img>` tag:

      `<img src="image-small.jpg" srcset="image-small.jpg 400w, image-medium.jpg 800w, image-large.jpg 1200w">`

 If the screen size is less than 400 pixels, the browser will use the `image-small.jpg` image source. If the screen size is between 400 and 800 pixels, the browser will use the `image-medium.jpg` image source. And if the screen size is greater than 800 pixels, the browser will use the `image-large.jpg` image source.

2. `sizes`: The `sizes` attribute is used to specify the size of the image in relation to the viewport. Here's an example of how to use the `sizes` attribute in an `<img>` tag:

    `<img src="image-small.jpg" srcset="image-small.jpg 400w, image-medium.jpg 800w, image-large.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 600px">`

The `sizes` attribute specifies three different `sizes` for the image based on the viewport size. If the viewport size is less than or equal to 480 pixels, the image will be displayed at 100% of the viewport width. If the viewport size is between 480 and 1200 pixels, the image will be displayed at 50% of the viewport width. And if the viewport size is greater than 1200 pixels, the image will be displayed at a fixed width of 600 pixels.

How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?

The srcset attribute in the `<img>` tag is specifically designed for responsive images

1. Browser-native solution: The srcset attribute is a browser-native solution that is built into HTML, whereas CSS and JavaScript are external technologies that need to be loaded and executed. This means that using srcset is often faster and more efficient than relying on external technologies.
2. Automated image selection: With srcset, the browser automatically selects the best image source based on the device's screen resolution and size, without the need for any additional scripting or calculations. This makes the process of selecting the appropriate image source much easier and more reliable than trying to do it with CSS or JavaScript.
3. No layout shift: Using srcset ensures that the image size and resolution are appropriate for the device, which helps to prevent layout shifts that can occur when the image is loaded and resized using CSS or JavaScript. This results in a smoother and more consistent user experience.
4. Accessibility: srcset supports the sizes attribute, which helps to optimize the image size for different viewport sizes. This ensures that the images are displayed at an appropriate size for the user's device, making it easier to view and understand the content of the image. This can be especially important for users with visual impairments or who are using assistive technologies.

Using `srcset` ensures that the images are optimized for the device and viewport size, resulting in a smoother and more accessible user experience.
