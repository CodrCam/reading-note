## Learn HTML

### Creating Hyperlinks

- To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
The href attribute contains what information?

An anchor tag, the href id the source location for the content.

- What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

Check the inspection accessibility feature and make sure there's no issue for the different;y abled.

## CSS Layout

### CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning

- What is meant by “normal flow”?

  The normal flow is descriptive of the elements and how they appear to the webpage. Each element is affected by the surrounding elements horizontally. Along with being responsive to the parent elements such as `height`, `width`, `margin`, and `padding`
  
  The flow can also be altered with floats and position. Which can give you exact control of the location, but this will have a literal cascading effect.

- What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
- Block-level has padding in all directions where inline only it on the left and right sides.
- Similarly Block-level can be affected to change the size, where as inline is dictated by its content.
- block-level can have inline nested in it.

- ___ positioning is the default for every html element.

Static, is the standard positioning. But can be changed to `relative`,`absolute`, `fixed`, or `sticky`.

- Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

Positional control

Layering is far easier to control as well

Absolute Isolation control over specific elements.

Easy centering to an element or parent container

- What is the key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
The big difference is fixed positioning works in reference to the viewport, where as absolute works off of the nearest element. 

### Learn JS

#### Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code

- Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
Function declaration is when you start with `function do(fun, stuff)`

Instead and invocation is more meat and potato where you call a function like `let activity = do(skiing, downhill)` by invoking your calling a function to do something.

- What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
A parameter is a placeholder in that it simply stands in place of the argument. Whereas the arg is a part passed through the function.

 For example `funtion PartyBus(busName)`

 busName is simply a place holder until a user enters the bus name to pass throught the function.

### Miscellaneous

- 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. Improved code quality - peer review

2. Faster turn around with constant movement

3. Knowledge Sharing - You get a ton from another mind that’s not yours.

4. Improved Communication - We all need to work on our sociability

5. Reduced Errors - with more eyeballs you can see a bigger picture.

6. More pride of contributions, we all benefit from helping lift each other up.

- Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

1. Knowledge Sharing - I don’t know it all, and never will but I have time to learn from others and improve myself.

2. Improved Comms - Whew… Covid took the ability for us to act appropriately at times and it’s something we all need to work on.
