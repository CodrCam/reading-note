# Expressions and Operators

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are way for you to establish values or variables that you would like to use in the code later on. One of the ways that you can do this is by utilizing the equal sign. When utilizing the equal sign alone or with a single symbol you are establishing to the computer that `this = this`.

For example:

`X = 4` and `Y = 5` When you `X * Y` you get `20`

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are utilized in a way to find true or false. This can be used in while loops as a Boolean.

`==` loosely, and can match ints and strings

`===` Exzact match or FALSE

`!=` does not equal

`<` less than `>` greater

### for statement

> `for (let i = 0; i < shade.length; i++) { 
> 
>   text += shade[i] + "<br>";
> }`

### While loop

> `while (i < 2) {
>
> text += "Number" + i;
>
> i++;
>
> }`
