# Javascript Programming

The way JavaScript interpret the language line by line. The only reason that it won't keep going line by line is if it is caught in a loop. There are if loops while loops and many others. If Loops also have components like else. Else lets you continue on if the Boolean within the if element isn't true. While loops facilitate a loop to continue while true, but once false the loop will stop.

### if else statement

> `for (let i = 0; i < shade.length; i++) { 
> 
>   text += shade[i] + "<br>";
> }`

### if else statement

> `if (hour < 18) {
> 
>   You = "Happy";
> 
> } else {
> 
>   You = "Sad…";
>   
> }`

### While loop

> `while (i < 2) {
>
> text += "Number" + i;
>
> i++;
>
> }`

### Function

> ‘let n = 2;
>
> function squares (num) {
>
> let equals = num * num;
>
> return equals;
>
> }
>
> let squares2 = squares(2);
>
> let squares2 = squares(8);`

### Operators

Operataors are similar to math. In fact they work in the same way to help the computer program make choices. 

`+, =, >, <,`

#### but there's other ways it works too

such as 42 + "42" concatinates it to 4242

#### so it's always good to refer to a guide.
