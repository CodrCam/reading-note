# JavaScript

JavaScript is a difficult language to nail down on what it actually does. That’s because it’s a versatile language that can accomplish making the web page more interactive. Also as an interpreted language it can be used in non-web environments such as database functionality. 

While JavaScript is an interpreted language it’s not to be confused with Java.
